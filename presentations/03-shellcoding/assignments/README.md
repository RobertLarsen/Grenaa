# Assignments #

Yeah, a word about what you find here.

## shelly ##
This is the program which illustrates 10 different difficulties when
uploading and executing shellcode. During the workshop we go through each one.

## treebuilder ##
The treebuilder is the final assignment. A 64 bit version of it was a challenge
during ProsaCTF 2013.

## WebServerShellcode ##
This is a large (~11k) shellcode I wrote for illustrating how multistage
shellcode works. Simply have a program execute it and point your browser to
http://target:9876/?viewer

That should give you a file browser. Try reversing just enough of it to be able
to change the port. As an extra challenge I have encoded it, but the encoder
is the first thing in the binary. Figure it out and undo it.
