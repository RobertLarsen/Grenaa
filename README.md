# Material for the Grenaa binary exploitation workshop

For this you should install the following:

* VirtualBox - https://www.virtualbox.org/
* Vagrant - https://www.vagrantup.com/
* Putty (or some other ssh klient) - http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/

You boot up the VM by executing 'vagrant up' in the directory where you cloned this repo.

Place a file called `build_asciidoc` in the root of this project before doing a `vagrant up` in order to install the tools needed for building the slides if you  want to build them yourself.

A YouTube channel showing how I get to my solutions can be found her:
